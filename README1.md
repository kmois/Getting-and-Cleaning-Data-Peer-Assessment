This file describes how the files involved in this project work and how
they are interconnected.

## Raw files used
My analysis used the following files from the original UCI HAR dataset
as provided to the students of Getting and Cleaning Data course:  

- features.txt, describing variables and their units  
- activity_labels.txt, listing the 6 kinds of activities  
- "X_train", "y_train" and "subject_train", in folders "test" and "train".   


## Files produced by me
I am submitting four files on Github:  

1. run_analysis.R - R code that automatically runs my analysis  
2. tidy_data.txt - The end product of my analysis, the tidy data set  
3. Codebook1.md - Outlining my analysis step by step and describing the 
variables in tidy_data.txt. The code book extensively refers to the 
documentation of the original UCI HAR dataset, which is assumed to be 
available to the reader.   
4. This README document, README1.md
